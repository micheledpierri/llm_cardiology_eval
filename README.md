**"Evaluating Large Language Models in Cardiology: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini"**

## Abstract

This study systematically compares the performance of three large language models (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) in cardiology-related clinical scenarios. Using 70 simulated prompts representing both pre- and post-diagnostic phases and two user profiles (patient and doctor), responses were rated by three expert cardiologists on four quality criteria: scientific accuracy, completeness, clarity, and coherence. Statistical analyses confirmed ChatGPT’s superiority, though no model achieved maximal performance. Results support the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and human-in-the-loop oversight.

## Study Design

- Models Evaluated: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google DeepMind)
- Prompts: 70 clinical questions stratified by diagnostic phase and user type
- Scoring: 5-point Likert scale, four criteria
- Reviewers: 3 blinded cardiologists
- Evaluation Period: September–December 2024

## Methods

- Non-parametric tests (Kruskal–Wallis, Dunn’s test, Mann–Whitney U)
- Inter-rater reliability (Kendall’s W, Weighted Kappa)
- Sensitivity analysis (leave-one-reviewer-out)
- All scripts written in Python 3.12
